# UoE-Individual-Project
This repository contains the code written for the Individual Project :An Investigation Into Methods For Enhancing Current Computational Technologies Using Brain-Like Designs In An FPGA Architecture

## References for Source Code
Thanks to Daniel and Jorge, whos project titled `Oscilloscope' proved to be a valuable educational resource and supplementary reference throughout the first principles approach that was taken to creating this system.

## What ideas came in useful from Daniel-and-Jorge's code:
### Data_Collection Subsystem
The idea of using a ring buffer to store and send data.

### VGA_Display_Renderer Subsystem
Learning in conjunction with Will Green's article at `https://timetoexplore.net/blog/arty-fpga-vga-verilog-01', how to devise a method for communicating with the VGA Display, and devising a method for controlling pixel switching on each frame render.
